        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <section id="subwords">
            <p>Hello, my name is Alex Davisson. Born and raised in Spokane, Washington, I graduated from Eastern Washington University in 2022 with a Bachelors degree in Computer Science and a certificate in UX Design. While I enjoy all art and sciences,
                I am particulary passionate about web design, photography, and programming. All images are taken by me and all designs, including this site, are original. Although this site is mostly focused on showcasing my designs, I also have a love
                for programming and have completed several projects. For any inquiries, please reach me through my social media listed below.</p>
