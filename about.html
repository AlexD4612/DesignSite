        <section id="subwords">
            <p>Hello, my name is Alex Davisson. Born and raised in Spokane, Washington, I graduated from Eastern Washington University in 2022 with a Bachelors degree in Computer Science and a UX Design Certificate. While I enjoy all art, I am particulary
                passionate about web design and photography. All images are taken by me and all designs, including this site, are original. Although this site is focused on showcasing my designs, I also have a love for programming and have several projects
                not seen here. For any inquiries, please reach me through my social media listed below.</p>
